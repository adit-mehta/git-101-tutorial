## Some Basic Git Commands:

`git init` - creates a new git repository

`git clone` - clones a remote repository to your local

`git status` - tells git to check whether any changes have been made to the branch

`git add` - proposes changes which we want to commit (adds the changes to a 'staging' area)

`git commit` - saves the changes made to the branch locally (i.e. we have now updated the branch locally)

`git push` - sends the snapshot of your local branch to the branch on the server

`git fetch` - tels your local to fetch any meta-data from the original repo

`git pull` - does what git fetch does but also brings new files to your local

`git branch` - shows you which branch you are on

`git branch -a` - lists all branches for the project

`git checkout <branch-name>` - switches to a different branch
